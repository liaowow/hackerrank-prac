You will be given:
the total amount of weight you can carry (weightCap)
the weights of all of the items in an array (weights)
the values of all of the items in an array (values)
Your function should return the maximum value that you will be able to carry.
Example:
weightCap = 5 
weights = [1, 3, 5]
values = [250, 300, 500]
i = 3
