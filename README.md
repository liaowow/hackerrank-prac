## Overview

Algorithm: A set of instructions for accomplishing a task.

Big O notation: A theoretical measurement of the *time* and *space* complexity of your algorithm/data sturcture. It's a convenient way to describe how fast a function growing (reference [here](https://yourbasic.org/algorithms/big-o-notation-explained/)).
